# Docs as Code

Keeping software and documentation together in the same place is great.
- Devs can read docs right from their IDE
- Docs stay up-to-date with code changes
- Single source-of-truth for project

The Grove uses [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) to render markdown files while respecting the project's existing directory structure.

The doc heirarchy IS the source code heirarchy, because docs live next to code.  If you can find a doc, you can also find the source.
