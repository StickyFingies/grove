## List of things to work on (todo):
- Vite + electron + preload + renderer
- `scripts/player.js` does too much (player + HUD + shooting)
- SharedArrayBuffer synchronization via Atomics

## Crazy ideas I have (incomplete list):
- Annotate code by having a Markdown file open side-by-side, that matches your scroll position in the code file.  Leave notes right next to individual lines, etc.
